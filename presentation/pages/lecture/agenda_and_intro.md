# What is AI?

- AI = systems that perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence  
- Early AI: expert systems, rules-based  
- Modern AI: machine learning → deep learning → generative AI  

📊 *Visual:* simple timeline showing expert systems → ML → deep learning → transformers

# Current State of AI

- Generative AI is everywhere: ChatGPT, Copilot, MidJourney, Claude  
- Powered by:  
  - Large datasets  
  - Transformer architectures  
  - GPUs & cloud compute  
- Limitations: hallucinations, bias, cost  

💡 “AI won’t replace you, but developers using AI will replace those who don’t.”
