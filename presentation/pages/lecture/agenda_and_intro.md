# Current State of AI

- Generative AI is everywhere: ChatGPT, Copilot, MidJourney, Claude  
- Powered by:  
  - Large datasets  
  - Transformer architectures  
  - GPUs & cloud compute  
- Limitations: hallucinations, bias, cost  

üí° ‚ÄúAI won‚Äôt replace you, but developers using AI will replace those who don‚Äôt.‚Äù
