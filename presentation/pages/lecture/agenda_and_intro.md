# What is AI?

- Systems that perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence  
- Early AI: expert systems, rules-based  
  - used "If-Then" logic, lacked ability to learn from new data and difficult to scale 
- Modern AI: machine learning ‚Üí deep learning ‚Üí generative AI

**2017**: *Attention Is All You Need* - Google introduced the [Transformer architecture](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf), which is the foundational model for almost all modern LLMs. More on this later!

**Future?**: *Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)* - SkyNet? The Matrix? AI wipes out humanity?

## Machine Learning and Deep Learning 

- *Machine Learning* (ML) - algorithms trained on data to make decisions or predictions without manual programming.
  - *Remote Sensing* - if you have ever done a [supervised or unsupervised classification](https://gisgeography.com/supervised-unsupervised-classification-arcgis/), then you have done some basic ML. 
- *Deep Learning* (DL) - sub type of ML that uses deep, multi-layered neural networks to learn hierarchal representations of data.

# Current State of AI

- Generative AI is everywhere: ChatGPT, Copilot, MidJourney, Claude  
  - creates new content such as text, code, images, audio, or video, from existing data 
- Powered by:  
  - Large datasets  
  - Transformer architectures  
  - GPUs & cloud compute  
- Limitations: hallucinations, bias, cost  

üí° ‚ÄúAI won‚Äôt replace you, but developers using AI will replace those who don‚Äôt.‚Äù
