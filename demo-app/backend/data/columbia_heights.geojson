Drivers will routinely travel down this road at 50+ mph due to their being no traffic calming measures whatsoever. This is super concerning given the amount of families and children that try to utilize the road, especially given the close proximity to one of the middle schools and the high school. There needs to be a sidewalk added, the driving lanes narrowed, and also some kind of slowing/stop mechanism at the corner of Chatham and Golf.

The city should either remove Jefferson from the route map or put in safe bike treatments. I would prefer to make this a safe route for bicycles as I ride nearby often.\n\nShoulders are a fine bike treatment in a rural context but in a city with parking the shoulder is not safe bike infrastructure.",

The SB bus stop should be imrpoved with the proposed development of this empty parcel by moving it to a bump out protected bus  stop, especially considering the future development will be mixed use with hopefull a grocery store that will produce more transit traffic.",

Additionally, this stretch of Central has a lot of jaywalking,  Couldn't we make use of a center island barrier (think of County road C in roseville near the Oval/City hall where the city has beautiful plants, trees, and bushes that both make the corridor look nice but also persuade pedestrians to walk to the nearest marked crossing.

The bridge should be signed for students to use and encourage students to cross via the bridge for enhanced safety during the higher pedestrian traffic times.  This is an instance of going against the flow of pedestrians who are telling you how they will cross.  You should make efforts to make the way they will cross safer.   Again, you will NEVER get people to use the bridge as long as the intersection exisits as is.  It is a far cheaper solution to paint crosswalks, add pedestrian signals, and leverage your center islands as pedestrian safe havens.  In many other cities, they have a fenced area on the island so that if the signal expires midway, they can safely wait for the next signal opportunity.  Far more effective than the bridge no one uses.",

Despite living only a few blocks away, we often drive to Dairy Queen or the Library because otherwise it's like walking along a highway. The traffic is way too fast and not aware of pedestrians. We should have a calm, walkable \"main street\" especially if we want to encourage more businesses. We are primed for more foot traffic with the new apartment building, and with DQ, the Library, City Hall, Heights Theater and several restaurants all in this area, it should be comfortable for residents to walk amongst these businesses. Other towns have successfully slowed down and improved the presence of their main street, so we should take cues from what others have done -- lower speed limit, speed bumps, etc.",

In lieu of a light, the signage needs to reflect that the traffic lane is for both left turns and straight-ahead traffic. The parking lane is only for right hand turns. Because the volume of traffic has increased over the years, there has been increased use of the parking lane by traffic wanting to go straight through the intersection. This creates a situation where people are afraid to turn left because they believe cars will hit them.",

IMO, crossing Central at 49/50th or 37th is key to riding to Main Street, or Columbia Parkway to get to East and West River routes using the viaduct. Main St and the path along the River thru the park are two safe ways to get north of 694 on a bike. They are also key to getting to the 7th St underpass (now excellent for biking.) Conversely, from west of Central, 49th/50th crossings are key to getting to the Matterhorn bridge. These important connecting crossings should be made safe.",

Steady traffic on Central kept us waiting our turn. Then the light turned green for east-bound traffic on 50th, across from us. The signal was first a green arrow for left turners. The pedestrian waited for his light; then he started walking when the walk light came on. When he was near the middle of the northbound side of Central, another car made a left turn. I honked to alert both the car and the walker. The car thankfully passed just ahead of the walker. ",

That was useless, naturally the request was denied. \n\nI then called last year and was told my request would be forwarded to a new commission being formed? \n\nEven in the Winter, children are crossing to go sledding on the small hill. \n\nWhy do all other parks get a crosswalk, but not Prestemon Park? \n\nI recall that Lomianki (west) may not have had one, but the streets there are not travelled much. \n\nPlease, a stop sign, a crosswalk, something.  20+ years I have seen little ones bolt across the street, so sad.",

There is a lot of foot traffic (my family of 6 walks this road daily and we are constantly dodging cars who are speeding around the corner onto 7th from 44th or coming down the hill on 7th from 43rd). This is especially scary in the winter with no sidewalk. There also is no light in this corner of the road on 7th for half the block. It is very dangerous for pedestrians. I have witnessed a bike/MVA accident at this corner. I don’t think people coming down the hill at night always see the stop sign. We could use another light in this area. ",
