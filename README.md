# Resistance is Futile: Embracing AI in GIS Web Development

This repo contains the [presentation](./presentation/) and [demo materials](./demo-app/) for the `Embracing AI in GIS Web Development` workshop at the [2025 MN GIS/LIS Annual Conference](https://www.mngislis.org/mpage/annualconference) in Duluth, MN October 1-3, 2025.

### Abstract

> Worried AI might take your job? Don’t panic — it’s way more fun to let it help with your job instead. In this hands-on workshop, we’ll explore how AI assistants like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot can supercharge your workflow, from writing cleaner code faster to automating tedious tasks.
> 
> But code isn’t the whole story — we’ll also dive into how large language models can help make sense of data. You’ll learn how to use LLMs to summarize large volumes of text, extract structured and unstructured information, and even build smarter tools using vector databases and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Whether you’re wrangling GIS datasets, building apps, or just trying to stay ahead of the AI curve, this session will give you practical skills and real examples you can start using right away.


## Demo Setup

The [demo-app](./demo-app/) features a Full Stack example complete with an API for working with Large Language Models (LLM) to enhance your web applications.
